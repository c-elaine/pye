problems worked on while reading through the python for everyone textbook

PYE Repository is a collection of completed exercises done when reading through the Python for Everyone book By Charles Severance. 
With each chapter, the complexity of the problem increased. Working through them slowly, trying to understand the concepts and the many different ways
that the problem can be solved, has aided in strengthening my understanding of the core concepts of Computer Science and Programming. 

The sole purpose of uploading this repository is to have a record of learning progression.
