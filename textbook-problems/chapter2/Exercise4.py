'''Exercise 4: Assume that we execute the following assignment statements
width = 17
height = 12.0

For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression
and the type (of the value of the expression)
'''

width = 17
height = 12.0

# width // 2 #Note that the // operator represents floor divison. Floor divison,
#divides the two numbers and rounds the result down to the nearest integer. 

#Answer: width // 2. Value of the expression is 8. Its type is a floor divison expression. 
#width / 2.0. Value of the expression is 8.5. This is a divison expression.
# #height/3. Value of the expression is 4.0. Division expression.  
#1 + 2 * 5. Value of the expression is 11. This is a multiplication and addition expression.
