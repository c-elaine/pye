#Exercise 1: What is the function of the secondary memory in a computer?
#Answer: C)Store information for the long term, even beyonce a power cycle. 

#Exercise 2: What is a program?
#Answer: A program is a sequence of statements to serve a particular purpose. 

#Exercise 3: What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
#Answer: A compiler translates input into machine language, whereas
#An interpreter returns output on the fly. The difference is in processing. 

#Exercise 4: Which of the following contains "machine code"?
#Answer: Python Interpreter. (Not sure about this one.)

#Exercise 5: What is wrong with the following code? 
'''
>>> primt 'Hello world!'
File "<stdin>", line 1
primt 'Hello world!'
^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
'''
#Answer: Print is spelled wrong and Hello World requires parentheses. 

#Exercise 6: Where in the computer is a variable such as x stored after
#the following Python line finishes?

#x = 123

#Answer: Main Memory. (Why not secondary, or CPU?)

#Exercise 7: What will the following program print out: 
'''
x = 43 
x = x + 1
print(x)
'''
#Answer: 44. The variable takes the previous variable value and updates it. 

#Exercise 8: Explain each of the following using an example of a human capability.

#Answer:
#Central Processing Unity: The brain of the computer. Only understands machine language. Gets data,
#from the main memory to use in computations and processes. 

#Main Memory: Short term memory. Stores only the data that is used locally in processes. Once the,
#computer is shut off, like switching tasks, this memory disappears. 

#Secondary Memory: Long term memory. Important information that needs to be remembered is stored here,
#even if the computer is off. Just like our name, its important so we remember it even if we're asleep.

#Input Device: Like food. For certain processes to occur, like eating, input needs to happen. 
#This is an external object that allows processing to start. 

#Output Device: Like a compliment. When you recieve one, you react. Typically by a verbal or facial
#expression. Like a human has a face to show output. The computers output is a screen. 

#Exercise 9: How do you fix a "Syntax Error"?
#Syntax Errors occur because something illegal has been typed into the script or interpreter. 
#To fix it, you must look through your vaules, variables and expressions to identify incorrect usage
#of the language.
